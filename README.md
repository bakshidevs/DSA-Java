# Problem Solving for 100 Days

Welcome to the **100 Days of Problem Solving** challenge! This repository documents my journey as I solve data structures and algorithms problems every day for 100 days using Java.

## About

The goal of this challenge is to improve problem-solving skills, deepen understanding of algorithms and data structures, and build consistency through daily practice.

## Structure

- Each day has its own folder containing:
  - The problem statement
  - Java solution(s)
  - Explanations and comments

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders by day.
2. Read the problem statement and review the provided Java solution.
3. Try solving the problem yourself before checking the solution.

## Progress

- [ ] Day 1
- [ ] Day 2
